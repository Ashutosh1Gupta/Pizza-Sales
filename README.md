Introduction

The Pizza Sales Dashboard project aims to analyze sales data from a pizza restaurant chain to gain insights into performance and make informed business decisions. The project involves running SQL queries to extract data from a relational database and then using the extracted data to create a dashboard in Microsoft Excel for further analysis and visualization.
